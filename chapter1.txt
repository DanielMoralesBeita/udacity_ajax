get and post requests in browser.
We exchage data by these requests.
This data exchange can be very useful.
We can pull data from any site and organise or manipulate it according to our needs.

At the end we will make an application which uses ajax to pull data from 3 different sites and make a very cool website which shows that data in a desired way.
